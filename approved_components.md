# Approved Components

This document lists all the approved components that can be used in the digital logic designs and PCB layouts for this project. Using only these components helps ensure compatibility, reliability, and simplifies the procurement and assembly processes.

## Components allowed in digital circuit designs:

The following components are approved for use in Digital when designing circuits, organized by category:

### Logic Components

The following components in the logic category are approved for use:
- Two-input AND gate
- Two-input OR gate
- NOT gate (Inverter)

You may additionally use any of the following logic gates with a single inverted input:
- Two-input NAND gate with one inverted input
- Two-input NOR gate with one inverted input
- Two-input AND gate with one inverted input
- Two-input OR gate with one inverted input

Any other logic components not listed here are not approved for use and should be constructed using the approved components.

**Note:** This is if we use the 74LVC1G97 multi-function gate IC.

### IO Components

The following components in the IO category are approved for use:
- Output (any bit width)
